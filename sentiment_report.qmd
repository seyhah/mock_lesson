# Introduction

This report analyzes customer comments using an AI model (`gpt-oss:20b` via Ollama).  
The pipeline performs the following steps:

1. Load raw comments data.  
2. Run **sentiment classification** (Positive, Negative, Neutral).  
3. Visualize the distribution of sentiments.  
4. Generate an **AI-powered summary** of the results.

# Step 1 â€” Import Libraries

We begin by importing the required Python libraries.  
- **pandas** for data handling.  
- **matplotlib** for visualization.  
- **ollama** for running the AI model locally.  

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from ollama import chat
